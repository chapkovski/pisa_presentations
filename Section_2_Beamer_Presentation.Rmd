## Introduction to oTree's  Architecture

-   **Main components of any oTree project:**

    -   Apps (+`settings`)

    -   Models

    -   Pages

    -   Templates

## Models in oTree

-  Use to define data to store at each level
-   There are five (nested) models:
  - Session:
     - Subsession
  - Participant:
     - Player
  - Group   
-   You can define new **fields** at Subession, Group, and Player level
-  You can store the data in `vars` at Session and Participant levels

## Pages in oTree

-   A page (in z-Tree term, screen) to show consists of 3 elements:
  - Page class 
  - position of the Page in the sequence of pages (`page_sequence`)
  - the html (text) to show in the `Page.html`


## Templates in oTree

-  within html of the page you can use:
  - plain html (`<b>hello, I am bold!</b>` will result in:
  **hello, I am bold!**)
  - CSS styles (look at the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/) for details)
  - JavaScript
  - and oTree own (kinda) template language to render  at the server side (retrieving data)
  

## Forms and User Input

-   Storing data at the model level (in **fields**)
-   Data validation:
   - Static (on the field level)
   - Dynamic (`{{field_name}}_min`, `{{field_name}}_max` etc)
-   Getting data from user:
  - Defining `form_model` and `form_fields` at the page level
  - Showing them at the specific place of the html page using `{{formfields}}`

## Displaying Data to Users

-   Showing static (`Constants)`and dynamic (from other users/same user) data
- Showing data conditionally (`{{if-else}}` structures) and in arrays (`{{for}}`)
-   Custom data formatting for a template (using `vars_for_template` and `js_vars`)

## Concept of Apps in oTree

-   An `app` is a set of models, pages, and templates.

-   Specific configuration in `settings.py` can group several apps together or launch the same app (or set of apps) with different parameters.

-   This can be used for between-session treatment assignment

## Exercise: Creating Your First oTree Project
\small
::: {style="font-size:10pt"}
-   Check if otree is installed: `otree version`

-   Create an empty project:  `otree startproject YOURPROJECTNAME`

    (choose 'No' when asked whether to add sample games!)

-   Move to a newly created folder:`cd YOURPROJECTNAME`

-   Create a new app: `otree startapp YOURAPP`

-   Register app in the `settings.py:`

    ```         
        dict(
            name='public_goods',
            app_sequence=['YOURAPP'],
            num_demo_participants=3,
        ),
    ```

-   Launch the server: `otree devserver`

    -   Sometimes right after installation oTree can ask to delete the temporary database file first (`db.sqlite3`) - just delete it.

-   Go to the local server in your browser: https://localhost:8000
