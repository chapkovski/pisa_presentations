## Interactivity in Experiments

-   Interactivity: Real-time Strategical interdependence
-   Note that most survey platforms like Qualtrics (\*), SurveyMonkey, and Survey.js do not support interactivity.
-   Practical level of interdependence:
    -   waiting for others
    -   conditional matching
    -   groups
    -   roles
    -   conditional flow

## Introduction to oTree

-   Python-based
-   two main versions (3.x - Django based; 5.x - starlette based)
-   there is a web-based version available (oTree Studio, <https://www.otreehub.com/studio/>)

## oTree and some competitors

## oTree as a Web Server

-   A sequence of HTTP responses over GET and POST requests to server
-   Python (3.8-3.11) at the backend; HTML+JS+\<template language\>at the front
-   storing and retrieving data from the relational database (sqlite/postgres)
-   CSS [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for quick formatting
-   [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for quick JavaScript code
-   Usually mobile responsive

## Shortcomings

-   Pretty steep learning curve

-   Not so easy to deploy (Git+Linux shell)

## Behavioral Experiments Overview

-   What do we need:
    -   Replicability (share your code on GitHub)
    -   Random assignments to treatments
    -   Re-use of the code across treatments (DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself)
    -   Attention checks
    -   Data validation
    -   Some anti-hacker measures (no returning back)
    -   Variable payoffs
    -   Integration with crowdsourcing platforms

## Randomization and Treatments

-   We'll have a separate section tomorrow
-   Important distinction:
    -   within-session treatment assignment:

        -   **PRO**: perfect balance, no time effects
        -   **CONTRA**: sometimes not possible

    -   between-session treatment assignment:

        -   **PRO**: logistically easy
        -   **CONTRA**: Never balanced; prone to criticism;

        try to balance, or simultaneous rooms

## Online Platforms Overview

-   Since oTree is just a web-server, it can be easily integrated with most of the crowdsourcing platforms:

    -   [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/)

    -   [Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk)](https://www.mturk.com/)

    -   [CloudResearch](https://app.cloudresearch.com/)

    -   [CloudResearch Connect](https://connect.cloudresearch.com/)

    -   [BeSample](https://besample.app/)

## Deployment and security

-   Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean

-   Local servers (most likely Linux-bases like Ubuntu)

Why locally?

-   State legislation

-   University regulations

<!-- -->

-   IRB

What kind of deanonymizing information can be collected: IP addresses, agent info, etc.
