## Basic oTree Experiment: Public Good Game - Overall Game Flow

1. **Contribution Decision Page**: Each player decides how much to contribute to the public good from their initial endowment.
2. **Wait Page**: All players wait until everyone in the group has made their decision.
    - `WaitPage`: When all players arrive, the total contributions are calculated, and payoffs are set.
3. **Results Page**: Players are shown their final payoff based on their contribution and the total contributions of the group.

## PGG: Variables and Parameters

- **Player-Level Variable**: 
    - `contribution`: Amount each player decides to contribute.
- **Group-Level Variables**: 
    - `total_contributions`: Sum of all player contributions in the group.
    - `individual_share`: Share of the total pool (after multiplication) for each player.
- **Constants / Fixed Parameters**:
    - `multiplier`: The factor by which the total contributions are multiplied.
    - `endowment`: Initial amount each player has to contribute.

### Project and App Setup Reminder

1. **Create a New oTree Project**:
    - Run `otree startproject pggproject`
    - **Important**: Say 'No' when oTree offers to add sample games!
2. **Change Directory to Project Folder**:
    - Run `cd pggproject`
3. **Create a New App Within the Project**:
    - Run `otree startapp pgg`
4. **Register the App in `settings.py`**:
    - Add `'pgg'` to the `SESSION_CONFIGS` list in `settings.py`



## Hardcoded Parameters and Session Configuration

### Constants in `__init__.py`

- `PLAYERS_PER_GROUP = 3`
- `ENDOWMENT = 20`
- `MULTIPLIER = 2`

### `settings.py`

```python
SESSION_CONFIGS = [
    dict(
        name='public_goods',
        app_sequence=['pgg'],
        num_demo_participants=3,
    ),
]
```


## Models: Data Structure

- **Player-Level Variable**: `contribution`
  ```python
  contribution = models.IntegerField()
  ```

- **Group-Level Variables**: `total_contributions`, `individual_share`
  ```python
  total_contributions = models.IntegerField()
  individual_share = models.IntegerField()
  ```

**Why Group-Level Variables?**
To store data that is common to a group of players, such as total contributions in a public goods game, we define variables at the group level.




## Page Structure with Stubs

### Decision Page: *Gather contributions from each player*

```python
class Decision(Page):
    pass
```

### ResultsWaitPage: *Wait for all players to make their decisions*

```python
class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):
    pass
```

### Results Page: *Show the outcomes based on contributions*

```python
class Results(Page):
    pass
```

## Data Collection

- Where the data gets stored and how to access it.
- A quick look at the admin interface for monitoring the experiment.

## Exercise

- Participants get to modify the game or add additional features.
